    <h2>Intro:</h2>
      <p>Hi! My name is Liz Wagner, a current student at Thinkful in their Software Engineering program living in Colorado, USA. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!</p>

    <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I have always enjoyed creating things with my hands and watching it take shape into something new. Usually it would be with yarn, bolts of fabric, or embroidery floss, but since starting the Thinkful program I've realized that coding is just another type of craft: using the building blocks and patterns of web design and using them to fashion something new. </li>
        <li>I am excited to start working on future projects with other developers so if you're looking to hire a new developer please contact me.</li>
      </ul>
