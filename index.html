      <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>I have always enjoyed creating things with my hands. Usually it would be with yarn, bolts of fabric, or embroidery floss, but since starting the Thinkful program I've realized that coding is just another type of craft: using the building blocks and patterns of web design to fashion it into something new. </p>
        
        <p>I am excited to start working on projects with other developers so if you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out.</p>
